I’ve been sitting here for the last hour, staring at the screen, unsure of what to write. It feels like my thoughts are all over the place, like they don’t fit together the way they used to. Maybe it’s just the stress from work, or maybe it’s something deeper. Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m just going through the motions, waiting for something to change, but not really sure what that something is.

I saw Ryan again last night. It was just a casual meet-up, nothing fancy, just the two of us grabbing a coffee and catching up. But somehow, it felt like more than that. I don’t know how to explain it. There’s always been this chemistry between us, this underlying current that we both try to ignore. We talk about everything and nothing all at once, and it always feels so easy, so natural. But I’ve been avoiding the one question that’s been nagging me in the back of my mind: Is there something more here, or is it just another fleeting moment?

Ryan is great. He’s smart, funny, and we have so much in common. He makes me laugh, which, let’s be honest, is one of the most important things to me. I need someone who can make me laugh, who doesn’t take life too seriously. And with him, it feels like we’re on the same wavelength, like we could talk for hours and never get bored. He’s the kind of person who doesn’t need to say much, but you can tell he’s listening, really listening, when you speak. And I love that. I love that he gets me without me having to explain myself over and over again.

But there’s something that’s been bothering me lately. As much as I enjoy our time together, as much as I find myself thinking about him long after we’ve parted ways, I’m not sure if he feels the same way. He’s never outright said that he wants something more, and I’ve been waiting for him to make the first move. I know that’s probably unfair of me, but I can’t help it. I’ve been burned before, and I’ve learned not to open up too quickly. But with Ryan, it’s different. I feel like he’s worth taking the risk. Still, there’s this uncertainty in the air whenever we’re together, this unspoken tension that I don’t know how to address.

The more I think about it, the more I wonder if I’m just overthinking everything. Maybe he’s waiting for me to make the first move. Maybe he’s just as unsure as I am, and we’re both stuck in this weird limbo, afraid to take the leap. I hate this feeling, this feeling of not knowing where I stand. I hate that I have to second-guess every little interaction we have, wondering if it’s a sign that he likes me or if it’s just friendly banter.

I’ve tried to talk to him about it before, but he always seems to brush it off, as if he doesn’t want to address the elephant in the room. I don’t want to push him, but I also don’t want to waste my time on someone who’s not on the same page as me. It’s not fair to either of us if we’re both pretending that things are fine when deep down, we both know they’re not.

So, what now? Do I keep waiting, hoping that he’ll come around, or do I take matters into my own hands and tell him how I feel? I know that being open and honest is the best thing to do, but what if he doesn’t feel the same way? What if he’s not ready for something more? I don’t know if I can handle that rejection, not again.

I guess I’ll just have to wait and see. I’ll wait for the right moment to tell him, or maybe he’ll just surprise me and say something first. Either way, I know I can’t keep going around in circles, pretending that I don’t have feelings for him.

I just hope that when the time comes, I’ll have the courage to take that leap.
