Another day, another realization. It seems like every time I think I’ve figured myself out, life throws me a curveball. I’ve spent years telling myself that I don’t need a relationship to be happy, that I’m fine on my own. And for the most part, I’ve believed that. But recently, I’ve started to wonder if I’ve been lying to myself.

I’ve been talking to someone for a while now, and his name is Jake. We met on this dating app, and we’ve had a few good conversations. He’s funny, smart, and easy to talk to, but there’s something about him that makes me hesitate. It’s not that I don’t like him—because I do—but I just don’t feel the intensity that I thought I would feel. Maybe I’ve set my expectations too high. Maybe I’m looking for fireworks, and I’m not giving him a chance to show me what he’s truly about.

Jake and I went out for dinner last night, and it was nice. We talked for hours, mostly about our childhoods, our experiences, and our values. I like that we seem to have similar goals and ideas about what we want in life. But after the date, I couldn’t shake this nagging feeling. It wasn’t that it was a bad date—it was just... okay. There was no spark, no real connection. We had a good time, but I couldn’t help but feel like I was just going through the motions. And I don’t want to be someone who just goes through the motions in a relationship.

I’ve been thinking a lot about my past relationships, and I wonder if I’ve been too quick to settle. I’ve had my fair share of flings, short-term relationships, and even a few long-term ones. Some were great, others not so much, but none of them ever felt like the right fit. There was always something missing. Maybe that’s why I’ve been so hesitant to dive into this one with Jake. I’m afraid of settling for something that’s just “fine.” I don’t want to waste time with someone unless there’s a real connection.

But I also don’t want to be too picky. I know that no relationship is perfect, and maybe I’m just expecting too much. I’ve been on a self-discovery journey for the past couple of years, focusing on building my career, my hobbies, and myself. I’ve become comfortable with my own company, and I’ve realized that I don’t need anyone else to complete me. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want a companion. I just want someone who matches my energy, someone who can bring out the best in me, and someone who’s on the same page as me when it comes to life goals.

So, what do I do with Jake? I’m not sure. Part of me wants to give it more time, see where it goes. But I also don’t want to waste his time if I’m not fully invested. I think I need to be honest with him about how I’m feeling. Maybe I’m being too cautious, or maybe I’m just not ready for what he’s offering. But if I don’t feel that spark, I don’t think it will develop into anything more than a pleasant friendship.

I’m learning that it’s okay to be uncertain. Not every connection needs to be perfect, but it also doesn’t need to be forced. I’m going to take things one step at a time and trust myself. If Jake is the right one, things will fall into place. If not, I’ll move on, and I’ll be okay.
