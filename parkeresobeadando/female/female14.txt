I’ve been thinking a lot about Mark lately. It’s almost impossible not to, with how much time we’ve spent together recently. I didn’t expect things to get this complicated. When we first met, I didn’t even think we’d end up becoming so close. We met through mutual friends and at first, it felt like just another casual friendship. I didn’t think anything would come of it. But here I am, feeling something I didn’t expect. I think I’ve started to develop feelings for him, and I’m not sure what to do about it.

The thing is, Mark is different from anyone I’ve ever met. He’s kind, thoughtful, and has this quiet intensity about him that draws me in. He’s not like the other guys I’ve been with, and that’s part of what makes it so hard for me to figure out what I’m feeling. He doesn’t try to impress people with flashy words or grand gestures. Instead, he’s just… real. There’s something comforting about being around him. I feel like I can be myself, and he still accepts me. Maybe that’s why I’m starting to realize that my feelings for him run deeper than I thought.

But it’s complicated. I’m not sure if he feels the same way. He’s always been a little distant, keeping things light, always joking around, never really showing his cards. Maybe I’m just overthinking it, but I get the sense that he’s holding back. I don’t know if it’s because of something from his past or if he just doesn’t feel the same way about me. I don’t want to push him into anything he’s not ready for, but at the same time, I can’t keep pretending that I don’t feel something. I’ve been down the road of unrequited love before, and it’s not something I’m eager to repeat.

We’ve shared so many great moments together. I can’t help but think about how easy it is to be with him, how our conversations flow so naturally. I look forward to the little things—his texts, the way he smiles when I say something silly, the way he listens to me when I talk about my day. But I’m afraid. I’m afraid of making a move, of telling him how I feel, and him not feeling the same way. I’m afraid of putting myself out there and having him pull away.

But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I can’t keep this to myself. I can’t keep pretending like it’s nothing. I need to know where we stand, even if it means risking my heart. I need to stop waiting for him to make the first move because I’m not sure he’s going to. I’ve been patient, but I can’t keep waiting in limbo forever.

So maybe it’s time for me to take the first step. Maybe it’s time to be brave, to open up to him and tell him how I feel. It’s scary, but I can’t live with the “what if” anymore. I’ve waited long enough. It’s time to face my fears head-on.
