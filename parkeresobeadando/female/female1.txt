I woke up early this morning, as usual. There’s something about the stillness of the morning that I love. It’s like the world is holding its breath, waiting for the day to start. I stretched and got out of bed, feeling a slight ache in my back. It’s been a while since I’ve had a full day to myself—no work commitments, no errands to run. It felt almost too good to be true. But as much as I wanted to rest, I knew I couldn’t just waste the day away.

I made myself a cup of coffee, the rich aroma filling the kitchen as I stood by the window, looking out at the quiet street. It’s been one of those weeks where everything feels out of sync, where my emotions seem to be a little all over the place. I’ve been busy with work, and while I enjoy my job, I’ve been feeling like there’s something missing. There’s a part of me that craves more—more connection, more intimacy. It’s not that I’m lonely. I have friends, family, my own space—but there’s a gap I can’t fill. A part of me wants to find someone who truly understands me, someone I can share my life with in a way that feels real and lasting.

I checked my dating profile today. It’s strange how many people just look at the surface—how many people swipe right without actually reading the profile. I guess I’m guilty of it too, sometimes. But there’s something about the act of scrolling through profiles that feels so hollow. I’ve been doing this for months now, and the novelty has worn off. Most of the time, I get a match, have a few conversations, and then the excitement fades away. I don’t know if it’s the way people use these apps, or if it’s just that I’m too picky, but I can’t help but feel frustrated with the whole process.

This morning, I got a message from someone new. His name is Alex, and his message stood out because it wasn’t just a “Hey, how’s it going?” It was a question about something deeper—he asked if I believe that relationships are built on compatibility or chemistry. I liked that. It felt like he was actually thinking about what matters, what makes a relationship work. I responded, telling him that while both are important, I think compatibility is what creates a solid foundation, but chemistry is what keeps it alive. He seemed to appreciate my response, and we had a bit of a back-and-forth. It was nice, but I didn’t want to get my hopes up. It’s easy to get carried away with someone’s words, but I’ve learned to take it slow.

Later in the afternoon, I went for a walk in the park. The air was crisp, and the trees were still holding on to their fall leaves, despite the chill. It felt good to just be outside, to not have to think about anything for a little while. But my mind kept drifting back to the same thought: am I being too picky? Is there someone out there who’s really right for me, or am I just stuck in an ideal that doesn’t exist? I want someone who’s kind, who’s independent but also knows how to make space for someone else. I want someone who’s emotionally intelligent, who can communicate openly without playing games.

In the evening, I met up with a few friends for dinner. We went to this cozy little restaurant downtown, and the food was amazing. It was nice to catch up with everyone, but as I listened to them talk about their own relationships, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit envious. They’ve all found their person, or at least they’re close to it. And here I am, still looking. Still hoping.

As I sit here, I think about what I really want. It’s not just about finding someone. It’s about building something that’s lasting, something that feels right. I’m tired of the games, tired of the small talk. I want a real connection. But I also want to be patient. I don’t want to rush into something that isn’t meant to be.

I don’t know where this journey will take me, but I do know that I’m not willing to settle. If anything, this journey of self-reflection and learning what I truly need has made me stronger. Maybe tomorrow, I’ll send Alex a message back. Maybe not. But whatever happens, I’m learning to trust that the right person will come along at the right time. For now, I’m going to enjoy the space I’ve carved for myself and see where life leads me.
