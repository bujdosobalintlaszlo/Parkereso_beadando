It feels like every day I’m walking around with this knot in my stomach. I’m constantly thinking about Mark, and I just can’t seem to figure him out. I think I’m falling for him, but I don’t know if he feels the same way. It’s frustrating, not knowing where you stand with someone, especially when you care about them so much. We’ve been friends for a while now, and lately, things have started to shift. It’s subtle, but it’s there. The tension between us, the way he looks at me sometimes, it’s like there’s something unspoken, something hanging in the air that neither of us is brave enough to address.

I’m not sure what I’m expecting from him. Maybe I’m looking for a sign that he’s ready to take this beyond friendship, or maybe I’m just hoping that he feels the same way I do. But I can’t keep waiting around forever, not knowing where things are going. I’ve been down this road before, and I’m not sure if I’m strong enough to go through it again. The last time I put my heart on the line, it didn’t end well. I’ve been hurt, and the scars are still there, even if I try to pretend they’re not.

But when I’m with Mark, it’s different. There’s something about the way he makes me laugh, the way he looks at me when we talk, that makes everything feel right. He’s a good person, a genuinely kind soul, and I can tell he cares about me. But he doesn’t say it. He doesn’t make any kind of move. And I’ve been wondering if I’m just imagining things, if maybe I’m reading too much into every little gesture. Maybe I’m overanalyzing everything. But it doesn’t feel like it. Every time we’re together, I feel a connection that’s impossible to ignore.

The worst part is that I’m scared. I’m scared of putting myself out there, scared of the possibility of rejection. What if he doesn’t feel the same way? What if I risk everything and end up losing him as a friend? I don’t think I could handle that. But at the same time, I can’t keep pretending that everything’s fine when I know deep down that I want more. It’s exhausting, pretending like I don’t care when every fiber of my being wants to tell him how I feel.

I’ve tried to play it cool. I’ve tried to act like it’s no big deal, like I’m okay with just being friends. But I’m not. And the more time I spend with him, the harder it becomes to pretend. There are moments when I catch him looking at me, and I wonder if he sees me the way I see him. Maybe he’s just waiting for me to make the first move. Maybe he’s scared too. I don’t know, but it’s driving me crazy.

I want to tell him, I do. I want to say the words, to be honest with him about how I feel. But I’m afraid of what might happen. I’m afraid of ruining the friendship we have, of making things awkward, of pushing him away. But I also know that if I don’t say anything, I might regret it for the rest of my life.

So, here I am, stuck in this emotional limbo, waiting for something to change. Waiting for him to take the first step, or for me to finally gather the courage to take it myself. I just wish I knew what he was thinking.

But for now, I guess I’ll keep going. I’ll keep pretending that everything’s fine, even though it’s not. I’ll keep waiting for the right moment, hoping that when it comes, I’ll be brave enough to take it.
