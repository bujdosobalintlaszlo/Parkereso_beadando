Today was one of those days where nothing seemed to make sense. The morning started off like any other — I got up, made coffee, and got ready for work. But even as I was going through my routine, there was this nagging feeling in the back of my mind, like something wasn’t quite right. I tried to push it aside, told myself it was just stress from the holidays approaching, but it didn’t go away.

I saw Ryan today. He came into the office for a quick meeting, and we ended up grabbing lunch afterward. As usual, we got along great. It’s easy with him, effortless even. But there’s something that’s been bothering me for a while now. Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m in some sort of limbo with him. We’ve spent a lot of time together over the past few months — dinners, drinks, movie nights — and yet, it’s always been just that. Casual. Nothing more, nothing less. But deep down, I can’t help but wonder if I’m just pretending not to care. I can’t stop thinking about him, about what we could be.

I’ve been holding back for so long, afraid to open up, afraid that if I show him how I really feel, it will ruin everything. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I’m not sure I can keep doing this. I’m not sure I can keep pretending that I don’t care. I’ve tried to keep things light, to keep things easy, but it’s getting harder and harder to ignore the truth. The truth is, I’m falling for him. And I don’t know how to stop it.

I can’t pinpoint exactly when it happened. Maybe it was the way he smiled at me that first night we met, or maybe it was the way he listened to me when I talked about my day, the way he made me feel like I was the most important person in the room. It could have been any number of little things that added up over time. But the truth is, I’ve started to care about him in a way that I’m not sure I can control. And that terrifies me.

I’ve tried to keep my distance, tried to remind myself that we’re just friends, that I’m not looking for anything more. But every time we hang out, every time we talk, it becomes harder to ignore what’s between us. And I can see it in his eyes. He’s holding back too. I don’t know if he’s afraid, if he’s unsure of what he wants, or if he just doesn’t feel the same way. But there’s something there — something that’s too strong to ignore.

I’ve been trying to find the right moment to tell him how I feel, but I don’t even know where to start. I don’t want to push him, and I don’t want to make things awkward between us. But every time I see him, I feel like I’m suffocating, like I’m keeping this secret locked inside me, and it’s eating me up. I want to tell him that I care about him, that I want more than just friendship. But I’m scared. I’m scared that it will change everything between us, that he won’t feel the same way, and it will be the end of what we have.

So, for now, I’ll just keep waiting. I’ll wait for the right moment, for the right words to come. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll find the courage to tell him how I feel. Because I can’t keep pretending. I can’t keep hiding it. The truth is, I want him. And I just hope that when the time comes, he’ll feel the same way.
