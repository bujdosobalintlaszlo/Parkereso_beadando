It’s strange, but I’ve been thinking a lot about Mark lately. More than I’d like to admit, if I’m being honest. The truth is, I didn’t expect to feel this way. When we first met, I had no intention of letting myself get emotionally attached. We were just two people with mutual friends, nothing more. But over the past few weeks, I’ve started noticing how much time I spend thinking about him, how much I look forward to hearing from him.

It’s frustrating because I know I should be focused on other things. My career is demanding, and I’ve worked so hard to get where I am today. I’ve made sacrifices, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished, but I can’t help but feel like something’s missing. When Mark is around, it’s like everything else fades into the background. He has this way of making me feel like I’m the only person in the room. It’s not just the way he listens to me, or the way he remembers the little things about my life. It’s how he makes me feel seen. He’s not afraid to be vulnerable, and I admire that about him. It’s refreshing, but also a little intimidating.

But at the same time, I feel like I’m not sure where I stand with him. We’ve talked a lot, and he’s opened up to me in ways I didn’t expect. But every time I think we’re getting closer, he pulls back. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but there’s something holding him back. I’ve been down this road before. I’ve dated guys who couldn’t commit, who had baggage they weren’t willing to deal with. And I’m scared that Mark might be one of those guys. I don’t want to fall for someone who’s just going to disappoint me in the end.

The worst part is, I think I’ve started to really like him. I don’t want to admit it, but it’s true. There’s something about the way he looks at me, the way he talks to me, that makes me feel… special. It’s been so long since I’ve felt this way, and I’m not sure how to handle it. I’m terrified of getting hurt again. I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t think I could go through that again. But at the same time, I can’t stop thinking about him. Every time I hear his voice, or get a text from him, I can’t help but smile. It’s like I’m addicted to the way he makes me feel.

I know I need to make a decision. Do I take a chance on him, even if it means risking my heart? Or do I pull away, protect myself, and focus on my career like I’ve always done? The truth is, I don’t know. But I do know that I don’t want to regret not taking a chance. I’ve always been the one to hold back, to play it safe. Maybe it’s time for me to stop being afraid of what could happen, and just go for it.

But the hardest part is that I don’t know if he feels the same way. Every time I try to read between the lines, I feel like I’m just imagining things. Maybe he just likes me as a friend. Maybe I’m overthinking everything, but the way he looks at me sometimes, the way he pays attention to the little details… I don’t know. I wish I could just ask him how he feels, but I’m terrified of hearing the wrong answer. What if he doesn’t feel the same way? What if he pulls away, and it changes everything between us?

I guess I just need to take a leap of faith. But I can’t help but wonder if it’s too late for that.
