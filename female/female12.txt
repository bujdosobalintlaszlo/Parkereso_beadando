It’s strange how everything can feel so clear and yet so confusing at the same time. I’ve been thinking about Mark all day. It’s been a few months since we first met, and every time I think I’ve figured out how I feel about him, I find myself second-guessing everything. It’s like I’m on the edge of something amazing, but I don’t know if I should take that final step or if I should just walk away and leave things as they are.

Mark is one of those people who makes you feel like you’ve known them forever, even if you’ve only just met. He has this quiet confidence about him, but there’s a softness beneath the surface that I find incredibly attractive. He’s the kind of person who remembers the little details—like the fact that I like my coffee with just a little bit of milk, or how I get nervous before big meetings. It’s these small things that make me feel like I’m more than just another person in his life. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel like something’s missing.

We’ve been spending a lot of time together lately, but there’s always this wall between us. It’s like there’s something unsaid, some unspoken tension that I can’t ignore. I can tell that he cares about me, but he doesn’t seem ready to take things further. I don’t know if it’s because he’s still recovering from past relationships, or if he just doesn’t feel the same way. Every time I think about asking him how he feels, I hold back because I don’t want to put him on the spot. I don’t want to scare him off, but at the same time, I can’t keep pretending that everything is fine when I’m just as confused as he is.

I keep telling myself that I should be patient, that everything will work itself out in time, but I’m not sure I can keep waiting. I need to know where we stand. I need to know if there’s a future for us or if I’m just wasting my time. I can’t keep giving him pieces of myself when I’m not sure if he’s ready to offer the same. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I’m not just afraid of rejection; I’m afraid of being hurt again. I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t know if I’m ready to go through that kind of pain again.

Still, when I’m with him, everything feels right. He makes me laugh in a way that no one else can, and there’s a comfort in his presence that makes me feel safe. I just wish I knew if he felt the same way. I wish I could just ask him what he wants, but I’m scared of what his answer might be.

I’m torn between waiting for him to open up or taking matters into my own hands and telling him how I feel. But I don’t want to push him away. I don’t want to force him into something he’s not ready for. I guess the best thing I can do right now is give him the space he needs and hope that, eventually, he’ll find the courage to let me in. But it’s hard. I wish I could just have the clarity to know what’s really going on in his mind.

For now, I’ll just keep waiting and hoping that the answers will come when the time is right.
