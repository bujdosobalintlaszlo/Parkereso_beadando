I’ve been thinking about Michael a lot lately. It’s strange how something can feel so right, yet so terrifying at the same time. We met almost three months ago, and since then, I’ve been trying to figure out where I stand. He’s a good guy—funny, thoughtful, easy to talk to. There’s a comfort with him that I haven’t felt in a long time. I’m not used to feeling so... seen. With Michael, I feel like I can be myself without any pretenses, and that’s something I haven’t experienced in a long time.

But I’m hesitant. It’s like there’s this little voice in my head telling me not to get too attached. I’ve been hurt before, and the thought of opening myself up to someone again scares me. I’ve spent so much time building my own life, focusing on my career and personal growth, that the idea of letting someone in feels like a huge risk. What if it doesn’t work out? What if it’s just another failed attempt at love?

Still, when we’re together, everything feels right. He makes me laugh like no one else can, and he listens to me in a way that makes me feel valued. He remembers the little details—like the fact that I love tea more than coffee, or that I have a soft spot for old movies. It’s the little things that matter, and Michael pays attention to them. It’s not something I take for granted.

I went home last night after our date, and I couldn’t stop smiling. I keep thinking about how easy it was to be with him, how relaxed and comfortable I felt. It was just dinner and a walk in the park, but there was something about the way he held my hand, the way we shared stories, and how natural everything felt. I realized that maybe I’m not as scared as I thought. Maybe I’m ready for this.

But what if I’m wrong? What if this isn’t as perfect as I think it is? I don’t want to make the same mistakes again, and I don’t want to rush into something just because it feels good in the moment. I need to take things slow, even though part of me wants to dive right in. Maybe I just need to trust myself and Michael a little more. Maybe this could be something real, something lasting. I guess only time will tell.
