I’ve been staring at the clock for what feels like hours, waiting for something—anything—to break the silence. The apartment feels emptier than usual tonight. I guess that's what happens when you spend most of your time in a place that’s too big for just one person. The sound of the clock ticking is almost deafening, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m wasting time. Wasting my own time.

I met Lily almost a year ago, but it feels like it’s been much longer. We started off as friends, or at least that’s what I thought it was. I wasn’t looking for anything serious, and neither was she. It was supposed to be casual, just some late-night texts, a few drinks here and there, and maybe a couple of movie nights. But over time, things shifted. Without even realizing it, she became such a huge part of my life that I could barely remember a time when she wasn’t there.

There’s this sense of comfort when I’m around her. I don't have to be anything other than myself. I can be completely honest with her, which, if you know me, is not something I’ve been able to do with anyone else. She gets me in a way that nobody else does, even when I’m being the most guarded version of myself. We can talk about anything—work, politics, the state of the world—and we do so with ease. But it’s not just the conversations that keep drawing me in. It’s the way she makes me feel. It’s as if, with her, I can let my guard down without fear of judgment. It’s the way she laughs at my jokes, even the bad ones. The way she looks at me when we’re in a room full of people, as though we’re the only two who matter.

But there’s a part of me that’s afraid. Afraid of how much I’ve let her in, afraid that I’ve crossed some invisible line that I can’t go back from. I’m not sure when it happened, but at some point, I stopped just thinking of her as someone I’m casually seeing and started thinking of her as someone who could be part of my life for the long haul. She’s become so ingrained in my daily routine that I can’t picture my future without her. And that thought scares me more than I care to admit.

We’ve talked about the future a little bit, about our plans and what we want to do in the coming years. Lily has this dream of moving to Europe and experiencing life abroad. She talks about it like it’s inevitable, like it’s something she’s going to do whether or not I’m on board with it. And I get it, I do. She’s driven, independent, and has always had a sense of wanderlust that’s contagious. I admire that about her. But the thought of her leaving makes me panic in a way I can’t explain. The idea of her being halfway across the world while I’m here, stuck in the same place, is something I can’t wrap my head around. And yet, at the same time, I know that I can’t hold her back. I can’t ask her to sacrifice her dreams just because I’m not ready to let go.

I’ve been asking myself a lot of questions lately. Do I love her? Is this love, or just a strong infatuation? And if it is love, am I ready for what comes with it? Because love isn’t just about being happy when you’re together, it’s about all the difficult conversations, the compromises, the trust. It’s about supporting each other through the ups and downs, even when life doesn’t go as planned. And I’m not sure if I’m ready for all of that.

The last time we were together, I could tell something was on her mind. She kept looking at me with that serious expression, the one she gets when she’s thinking about something important. I didn’t ask her about it at the time because I didn’t want to pressure her, but I’ve been wondering ever since if she’s feeling the same way I am. Is she thinking about the future? About us? About whether or not this is something she wants to keep investing in, or if she feels like she’s outgrown me?

I’ve always been the type of person who keeps things at arm’s length. I’ve been burned before, and I’ve learned to protect myself by keeping my emotions in check. But Lily makes it hard to do that. She’s patient with me, understanding when I pull away, but she also knows when to push, when to ask the hard questions that force me to face my own fears. And as much as I hate it in the moment, I know that it’s what I need. I need someone who can challenge me, someone who can see through my walls and make me realize that maybe it’s okay to let someone in. Maybe it’s okay to stop playing it safe for once.

This weekend, we’re going to visit her parents. It’s the first time I’ve met them, and I’m nervous. I know she’s close to them, and I want them to like me, but I also want to make a good impression on her. I want them to see that I care about their daughter, that I’m serious about her, and that I’m not just some guy who’s passing through. But what if they don’t like me? What if I’m not good enough for her, in their eyes or in my own?

I guess I’ll find out soon enough.
