Waking up this morning, I could feel that something was different. Maybe it was the slight shift in the air, the crispness that hinted at winter creeping in, or maybe it was just my state of mind. Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit off. There’s an underlying restlessness that I can’t quite shake. I don’t know if it’s the never-ending cycle of work and small talk, the endless scrolling through dating profiles, or just the fact that I’m getting older and wondering if I’m really any closer to figuring out what I want from my life.

My alarm went off at 7:30, the usual time, and I got out of bed like I always do. Coffee first, then a quick shower, and before I knew it, I was sitting in front of my laptop, working. It’s funny how the routine starts to feel like a crutch. I’ve been working from home for almost a year now, and while I appreciate the freedom it gives me, I can’t help but feel a bit disconnected. The isolation is starting to wear on me. I miss the hustle of an office, the random interactions with coworkers, the casual coffee breaks. Now, it's just me and the screen, staring back at me as I type away at whatever task is on my plate.

I’ve been using the dating apps for a while now, mostly as a distraction. There’s something so strange about them, isn’t there? The whole process of judging someone based on a few pictures and a short bio. It feels so shallow, yet, here I am, scrolling like everyone else. It’s not even that I’m actively looking for anything serious, but it’s hard to avoid the idea of finding someone who gets me. I guess that’s the appeal, isn’t it? To find someone who sees you, who understands the complexities of who you are without you having to explain it all. But even though I’ve connected with a few people on these apps, I can’t seem to make it past the initial conversation.

I’m always wondering if it’s just me. Maybe I’m not putting enough effort into these connections. Maybe I’m too guarded, too cautious. I’ve had my heart broken a few times in the past, and while I wouldn’t say that I’m scarred, I definitely don’t go into things without being careful. There’s a part of me that’s afraid of opening up again. I don’t know if I could handle that kind of vulnerability. But then again, I think about what I’m missing out on. How can I expect to find something real if I’m not willing to take any risks?

This morning, I got a message from a woman named Olivia. Her profile was interesting—not the usual “adventurer” or “food lover” cliché, but something more thoughtful. She said she was looking for something deeper, someone she could have meaningful conversations with. Her message was simple but intriguing. She asked me if I believe in fate or if I think relationships are just the result of chance. I’ve been thinking about that all day.

I told her that I believe in a bit of both. That there are people who come into our lives at the right time, but that we also have to be open and willing to put effort into building something real. Relationships are more than just destiny—they take work, communication, and the willingness to evolve. She replied, and we exchanged a few more messages. There was a lightness in our conversation, something that felt easy, which I hadn’t experienced in a while. For once, I didn’t feel like I was trying too hard, or that I had to be someone I’m not.

The rest of the day went by quickly. I kept myself busy with work, but my mind kept returning to Olivia’s messages. I started to wonder if maybe she could be someone I connect with. But then again, I’ve had these thoughts before. How many times have I felt that initial spark, only for it to fizzle out? It’s hard to avoid the feeling that it’s all just temporary. But I don’t want to be cynical about it. Maybe I’m just overthinking things again.

I talked to my friend Tom later on. He’s the kind of guy who’s always telling me to stop worrying so much and just enjoy the ride. He’s right, of course. I’ve been so focused on what could go wrong that I haven’t given myself the chance to just experience things as they come. But that’s easier said than done. When you’ve been hurt before, it’s hard not to be cautious. It’s hard not to protect yourself from the inevitable disappointment.

But maybe I need to let go of that fear. Maybe I need to stop worrying so much about the outcome and just see where things go. I’ve spent too much time wondering what could be, rather than enjoying what is.

After dinner, I took a walk. The cold air was a sharp contrast to the warmth inside, and it felt refreshing. The streets were quiet, and the city felt still, almost like it was holding its breath too. I thought about how I’ve been approaching dating—how I’ve been holding myself back out of fear, out of past experiences. It’s like I’m waiting for the perfect moment, the perfect person, but maybe there is no perfect moment. Maybe the only thing I can do is take chances and let things unfold naturally.

Tomorrow, I’ll message Olivia again. I don’t know what will come of it, but for the first time in a while, I feel a bit of excitement. Maybe that’s the first step. Maybe that’s all I need to start seeing things in a different light.
