I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how things have been going with Sarah. It's funny how things can evolve from casual conversations into something much deeper without even realizing it. I don’t want to rush into anything, but I’m definitely starting to feel something here. It’s been a few months since we first met, and I can’t help but admire how easy it is to talk to her. From the first time we met, I knew there was something about her that was different from everyone else. There was this warmth, this unspoken connection that made me feel at ease.

When we talk, it's like time stands still. I find myself sharing parts of my life I haven’t spoken to anyone about in years. My past, my dreams, even the little things that usually stay inside my head—Sarah seems to bring them out effortlessly. I appreciate that. It’s not often that I meet someone who can hold my attention and make me feel comfortable enough to be open.

Still, I find myself questioning how much I really want to dive into this. I’ve been independent for so long, and the thought of having someone in my life on a more permanent level is both exciting and intimidating. I have my own space, my own routine, and I like it that way. But Sarah... she’s starting to make me rethink things. Maybe it’s time to let someone in.

We went out last night, just the two of us, and had an incredible time. We talked, laughed, and really connected in a way that felt natural. Afterward, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. My mind kept replaying the little moments: the way she laughed, the way her eyes sparkled when she spoke about her passions, the way her hand brushed mine by accident as we walked to the car. It felt intimate in a way I wasn’t expecting.

The problem is, I don’t know if she feels the same way. It’s hard for me to be vulnerable with someone, and sometimes I’m not sure if I’m reading the signals right. I don’t want to make things awkward or rush into something she’s not ready for. But at the same time, I can’t deny how I feel. I want to see where this could go. I just have to find the courage to take that next step.
