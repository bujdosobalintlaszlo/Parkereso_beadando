Today has been one of those days where everything feels like it's moving too fast, but in a way that’s also painfully slow. I woke up feeling more unsure than usual, not because of anything specific but just because I can’t shake this lingering sense of doubt. I’ve been thinking a lot about Laura lately, more than I care to admit. She’s been in my life for a while now, and every time we meet, I feel more conflicted about where I stand.

Laura is the kind of woman who makes everything feel effortless. When she smiles, everything seems brighter. There’s a kindness in her that’s so genuine, it’s impossible not to feel drawn to her. I can tell that she’s different from anyone I’ve ever known. She listens with patience, and every conversation with her feels meaningful, like she’s truly interested in what I have to say. But for some reason, I keep holding back. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I’ve been through this before. Maybe it’s because I’ve been hurt, and I don’t want to go through it again. The idea of opening up to someone again, of giving them my heart, feels so daunting.

We’ve spent a lot of time together recently, and honestly, I’m not sure if I’m just being paranoid, but I feel like there’s something unspoken between us. I think she knows how I feel, or at least, I think she senses it. I want to tell her, but every time I get close, I back out. I can’t explain why—maybe I’m just afraid of rejection, or maybe I’m afraid of how things will change between us if I admit that I’m falling for her. Things are so easy right now, and I don’t want to complicate them.

I think the biggest issue I’m struggling with is trust. I’ve trusted people before, given them everything I had, and in the end, it wasn’t enough. I don’t want to put myself in that position again, but at the same time, I don’t want to let my past define my future. I can’t keep hiding from the possibility of something real just because I’m afraid of what might happen. But every time I start to let my guard down, I get scared.

Maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe I should just tell her how I feel and stop pretending that I’m okay with everything staying the way it is. Maybe that’s what she wants too. I can’t keep living in this state of confusion. I need to figure out if I’m ready to take the next step with her. I don’t want to lose her, but I also don’t want to dive into something without knowing for sure that it’s the right thing for both of us.

I wish I could be more certain, but for now, all I can do is hope that I’ll have the courage to tell her what I need to say. I just hope I don’t screw it up.
