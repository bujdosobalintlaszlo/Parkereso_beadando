I can’t help but feel like I’m running in circles lately. It’s almost as if I’m going through the motions, checking off the tasks, but none of it feels fulfilling anymore. I’m 34 now, and I find myself questioning the choices I’ve made. I’ve been single for almost two years after my last relationship ended. At first, I told myself it was all right. Time would heal, and I’d get back out there. But now? I’m not so sure anymore.

Dating feels so different now, almost mechanical. It’s like people are more interested in presenting a version of themselves that they think others will like instead of being their true selves. I’ve met a few women on the apps, but nothing feels genuine. It’s like we’re just two people exchanging pleasantries, and after a few days of chatting, the connection fizzles out. Maybe it’s my fault—I haven’t exactly been putting myself out there in the way I should. I don’t know what I’m waiting for. It’s as if I’m holding onto some ideal of a perfect partner, someone who checks all the boxes, but I’ve come to realize that this is probably just a fantasy.

I’ve been talking to a woman named Sarah for the past couple of weeks. She seems nice, but I can’t help but feel like we’re not quite on the same wavelength. It’s strange because we have so many similarities. We both love hiking, we both value honesty, and we share an interest in art. But when I’m talking to her, I don’t get that spark, that excitement. Instead, it feels like we’re going through a routine—talking about our day, sharing a few laughs, and then getting back to our busy lives. I don’t know if it’s just the way things go these days or if there’s something deeper at play, but it’s starting to feel like I’m just wasting both of our time.

I decided to take a break from the dating apps this weekend. I needed to clear my mind. I went for a run and spent the afternoon at the coffee shop I usually go to on weekends. There’s something about the routine that I find comforting. The smell of freshly brewed coffee, the soft chatter in the background, and the quiet hum of the city outside—it all feels like a simple reminder of what really matters. I sat there for a while, just lost in thought. I’ve been so wrapped up in the idea of meeting someone that I’ve forgotten what I actually need from a relationship. It’s not about finding someone to fill a void or to meet some checklist. I’ve realized that I want someone who can challenge me, who can make me laugh, who shares my curiosity about the world. I want someone who’s not afraid to be vulnerable and honest, someone who can see the beauty in the small things. I think I’ve been waiting for the wrong thing.

Later, I got a text from Sarah. She asked how my weekend had been, and I told her I’d spent some time reflecting. We talked a little more, but it wasn’t until the end of the conversation that something shifted. She asked me what I was looking for in a partner, and I gave her a simple answer: someone who knows who they are and isn’t afraid to show it. She said she could understand that, and it felt like we were finally talking on a deeper level. It’s small, but it feels like progress. Maybe this is where things start to feel real.

I think I’ve been too focused on the wrong things, trying to make connections based on surface-level stuff. It’s time to slow down, take a step back, and really think about what I want. I can’t expect everything to fall into place instantly. Relationships take time, and sometimes the best ones come when you least expect it. Maybe I’ll give Sarah another chance. Or maybe this is just one of those fleeting connections that comes and goes. Either way, I’m ready to find out.
