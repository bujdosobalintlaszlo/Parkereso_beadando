I woke up today feeling that strange sense of dread that I often can’t explain. The alarm clock blared in my ear, pulling me from a dream that I barely remember now. It was the kind of morning where everything felt slightly out of place. Maybe it was the grey clouds hanging low in the sky or the chill in the air that crept through the windows. I stretched and sighed, knowing that today would be one of those days where I had to drag myself through. But then, I caught myself—why am I letting one small moment dictate my entire mood? I promised myself to try and turn it around.

I’ve been in a weird place lately, and I’ve been trying to figure out exactly what’s going on. I’ve been on these dating apps for months now, scrolling endlessly through profiles, hoping to find someone who would feel like home. It's strange, isn't it? How we use technology to look for something so personal, so human. We’re all just swiping left and right, chasing something that feels real, but most of the time, it all feels so shallow. Even the conversations tend to fall flat. Maybe it’s me, or maybe it’s just the nature of dating apps.

I spent the morning working from home. I like the solitude—there’s a kind of comfort in knowing I can handle my tasks without the distractions of an office, but it’s also lonely sometimes. I think about the last serious relationship I had and how, back then, everything seemed so effortless. I didn’t have to ask for attention, and I certainly didn’t have to worry if they were going to text me back. It was just there. Maybe it was naive to think that kind of connection could last forever, but it’s hard not to miss it. I find myself wondering if it’s possible to feel that kind of deep connection again.

I checked my dating profile again around lunch. I don’t know why I do this. It’s like some sort of compulsive check-in to see if I’ve gotten any more matches, any more attention. I get a message here and there, but most of them feel like the same thing. Small talk. Hi, how are you? What do you do for fun? It’s exhausting. I don’t know how other people do it. How do they find the energy to keep answering these questions over and over again? There’s a part of me that’s convinced I’m doing it wrong. I should be more engaging, more fun, maybe more spontaneous, but honestly, I’m not sure that’s me anymore. The more I try to be someone I’m not, the less I recognize myself in these exchanges.

And then, this morning, I got a message from someone new. Her name is Emma, and her profile picture showed her at some sort of art gallery, a glass of wine in hand, smiling like she’s been there a hundred times. It’s funny how one picture can tell you so much about a person without even saying a word. Her message was simple: “What’s your idea of a perfect Sunday?” And, of course, my first instinct was to overthink the response. Should I be playful? Casual? Serious? What would make me sound like I know how to have a real conversation?

But I answered honestly. I told her that my perfect Sunday is a quiet one—waking up with no agenda, having coffee while reading or journaling, taking a long walk outside to clear my head, and maybe cooking a nice meal. It’s not an exciting answer, but it’s the truth. I think there’s beauty in simplicity, in quiet moments that allow you to recharge. She replied, and we had a few more messages back and forth. She seems nice, but of course, I can’t help but wonder if she’s really who she says she is or if we’ll just get stuck in another cycle of texts that go nowhere. It’s the cynical part of me that’s started to take over, and I don’t want to be that guy.

The afternoon dragged on. I tried to stay productive, but my mind kept wandering. I thought about my ex. I don’t talk about her much with anyone, but she still lingers in the back of my mind. It’s not like I want to go back, but sometimes I miss the feeling of being understood by someone. It’s so rare, that kind of connection. I wonder if it’s possible to find again, or if I’m destined to keep meeting people who are just placeholders, temporary figures in my life.

I met up with my buddy Jake later in the day. He’s been trying to convince me to take a more relaxed approach to dating. “Just go for it,” he says. “Stop thinking so much about it.” But it’s hard to do that. Every part of me wants to just dive in and see what happens, but I’ve done that before. I’ve put myself out there, trusted people, and gotten hurt. It’s hard not to be cautious when you’ve been burned. But Jake is right about one thing: I’ve been overthinking everything for so long. Maybe I’m not giving myself enough room to breathe.

I don’t know what will happen with Emma. I don’t know if she’ll be someone who could really be a part of my life or just another face in a sea of people I’ve tried and failed to connect with. But maybe that’s the point of all of this—maybe I need to stop searching for something perfect and just be open to the process, to the idea of getting to know someone without putting too much pressure on it. If I focus too much on what’s next, I’m going to miss what’s happening right in front of me.

I ended the night with a long walk around the neighborhood. The cold air hit my face, and for a moment, I felt a sense of calm. Maybe I don’t need to have it all figured out right now. Maybe life is just about taking things one step at a time. And maybe, just maybe, the right person will come along when I stop trying so hard to make it happen.
