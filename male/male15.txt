It’s been an exhausting week, emotionally speaking. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just setting myself up for failure by thinking too much about everything, especially when it comes to Sarah. I’ve been through enough relationships to know that they’re never as perfect as they seem at first. And yet, every time I talk to her, it feels like I’m falling deeper and deeper into something I’m not sure I’m ready for.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. When I first met her, I thought I could keep things casual. We were just two people who seemed to hit it off, right? A couple of shared interests, some laughs, easy conversations. But now, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m on the verge of something more, something that could either be amazing or fall apart in a heartbeat.

It’s funny how quickly things can change. I never planned on getting attached, but Sarah has this way about her that pulls you in. She’s genuine, down to earth, but still confident in her own skin. It’s hard not to admire someone like that. She’s also independent, which I respect. I’ve had my fair share of people who needed constant attention, but Sarah is different. She knows who she is and what she wants, and I can see that when I look at her.

But the more I get to know her, the more I realize I’m scared. I don’t want to repeat past mistakes, and I don’t want to risk it all for something that might not work out. I’ve been burned before, and it’s left scars that are hard to ignore. It’s like every time I get too close to someone, I can feel that old fear creeping back in—the fear of being hurt again, of being left behind when it all falls apart. I keep telling myself to keep my distance, to not let myself get too invested, but then I’ll look at Sarah and see that smile or hear her laugh, and all my defenses crumble.

What makes this harder is that she’s not like anyone I’ve met before. She has this softness to her, but she’s also strong. She’s the kind of person who believes in fairness, who stands up for what’s right. I admire that about her. I want to be close to her, but I also know that it’s not just about me anymore. She deserves someone who is sure about what they want. I’m not sure if I’m there yet. I want to be, but there’s a part of me that hesitates.

We had a conversation last night that I can’t stop thinking about. She was talking about her dreams—her career, her life goals—and for the first time, I realized just how ambitious she is. It’s inspiring to see someone so driven, so passionate about what they do. But in a way, it made me feel a little small, like I’m just coasting while she’s out there making a real impact. I don’t want to hold her back, but at the same time, I can’t help but feel this pull toward her. I want to be someone who can support her, someone who can stand beside her and cheer her on as she goes after everything she wants. But how can I do that when I can’t even figure out where I stand?

The thought of her with someone else, someone who has their life figured out, makes me uncomfortable. It’s not jealousy, exactly, but it’s this fear of losing something I don’t even have yet. It’s frustrating. I’ve been so focused on building my career, on getting to a place where I feel like I have my life together, and now that I’m starting to feel like I’m getting somewhere, I meet her. She’s the kind of woman who deserves someone who’s got it all figured out, who’s ready to give everything. But I’m not sure I’m there yet.

Still, I can’t stop thinking about her. Every text, every little exchange between us only pulls me deeper into this uncertainty. The hardest part is knowing that she probably doesn’t feel the same way. Maybe she does, but she’s also got her own stuff to deal with. Maybe I’m just another friend to her, someone to talk to when she’s bored. And maybe that’s all I am to her, but it’s hard for me to ignore the connection I feel.

I think I need to make a decision. Either I stay where I am—on the sidelines, unsure and holding back—or I take the leap. I’m not sure I’m ready to take that leap, but if I don’t, I know I’ll regret it. The worst part is knowing that no matter what I choose, it’s going to change everything. But maybe change is exactly what I need.
