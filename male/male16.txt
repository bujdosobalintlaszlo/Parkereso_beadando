I woke up this morning feeling restless. My mind keeps racing, and I don’t know if it’s the late-night thoughts that kept me up, or just the overwhelming feeling of uncertainty that I can’t shake. I keep thinking about Lauren and what I should be doing, or even more so, what I shouldn't be doing.

It feels like I’ve known her forever, though it hasn’t been long. We met at a friend's party, and at first, I didn’t think much of it. You know how it is—small talk, laughs, nothing too deep. But there was something different about her. Something about the way she talked, the way she listened so intently. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I was drawn to her. It wasn’t just her looks, although she’s beautiful—everyone can see that. It was her presence. She carries herself with this natural confidence that’s impossible to ignore, and yet, she’s not arrogant. She’s down to earth and incredibly intelligent.

Over the past few weeks, we’ve spent more time together, and every moment I’m with her feels like it could be a turning point. And that scares me. I’ve always been the type of guy to avoid commitment. Relationships, to me, were about temporary enjoyment, not long-term plans. I told myself I was fine with that; I was content. But every time I talk to Lauren, I feel like I’m on the edge of something deeper, something real. It’s like this unspoken connection that I don’t know how to handle. It’s not like the others. It’s not casual. And I’ve been avoiding acknowledging that for as long as I could.

The worst part is that I don’t know how she feels. She’s always so open with me, but there’s a part of me that wonders if she’s just being friendly. I can’t help but question her motives sometimes. Is she looking for something serious, or is this just a fun thing for her, too? I don’t want to be the one to put my heart on the line if she’s not looking for the same kind of connection. But then, I see the way she looks at me, the way she smiles, and I feel this pull that’s impossible to ignore.

It’s been a week since we had that conversation about our futures. I don’t think she realized how much it affected me, but I’ve been replaying it in my head nonstop. She asked me about what I wanted in life, about my career goals and what I envisioned for the future. The truth is, I don’t have all the answers. Sure, I have a general idea of where I’m headed, but I never really stopped to think about what my life would look like if someone else was in it. What would I want? What would we want? I can’t seem to picture a clear future, but with her, it feels like I could have one.

When I first met her, I was in that phase of just coasting through life, living day-to-day, making sure I was hitting my professional goals but avoiding anything too personal or too permanent. But now, after these past few weeks with her, I feel like I’ve reached a crossroads. I don’t want to miss out on something amazing just because I’m afraid of commitment. I don’t want to be the guy who regrets not giving it a chance, but at the same time, I don’t want to be the guy who falls too fast and gets burned.

Lauren deserves someone who’s sure of themselves, someone who can offer more than just half-hearted effort. She deserves someone who can step up and be present in a relationship, not someone who’s holding back out of fear. I know I have to make a decision, but it’s so hard to let go of my reservations. The fear of failing again, of not being good enough, is always lurking. I can feel the weight of it on my chest, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that I’ll never know unless I take that step.

This week, we’re going on a weekend trip to the mountains. It’s a casual thing, just a break from work and life, but I can’t help but think it might be a turning point for us. I’m nervous. I don’t know if it’s because I’m scared of what might happen or because I’m finally allowing myself to feel something for her. Either way, I know things are about to get real, and I don’t think I can avoid it anymore. It’s time to decide what I really want.
