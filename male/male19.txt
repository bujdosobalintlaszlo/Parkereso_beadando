It’s been a strange few days. I don’t really know how to describe it, but everything feels different. It’s as though the world around me has shifted, and I’ve somehow been left behind, trying to catch up. Maybe it’s just me, or maybe it’s something bigger, but I’ve been feeling more disconnected than ever before.

I went out with friends last night. I wasn’t really in the mood to go, but they convinced me. You know how it is—you tell yourself you’re fine, that everything’s okay, and that you don’t need anyone, but then someone reaches out, and you feel like you owe it to yourself to try to break the silence, even if you’re not sure what you’re looking for. So, I went. It wasn’t a bad time, not by any means. We laughed, joked around, had a few drinks. But there was something about the whole night that felt off. I kept looking around, seeing all these happy faces, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was just pretending to be part of it. That I was standing on the outside looking in, like I didn’t belong.

And then there was Sarah. She was there, of course. She’s been in my life for a while now, ever since we met through mutual friends about six months ago. At first, I didn’t think much of it. She was fun, easygoing, and we got along just fine. We’d hang out, talk about random stuff, and I’d always leave feeling like I had a good time. But lately, I’ve started to notice how much she’s become a part of my life. I’m not sure when it happened, but it seems like every time I talk to her, I’m more and more drawn to her. It’s not just physical attraction, though that’s definitely there. It’s more than that. It’s the way she listens when I talk, the way she remembers the little things I say. It’s the way she makes me feel seen, like I’m not just some guy passing through her life, but someone she actually cares about.

But I don’t know if I’m ready for this. I don’t know if I’m ready to let someone in that way again. The last time I got close to someone, it ended in disaster. I’ve been so focused on protecting myself from getting hurt that I’ve built walls so high around me, I don’t even know how to tear them down anymore. I’ve been trying to figure out if I can allow myself to be vulnerable with her, to let her see who I really am, without the fear of her walking away. But I’m terrified. I’m terrified that if I let her in, I’ll lose myself in the process.

I’ve been thinking a lot about trust lately. What does it really mean to trust someone? Can you trust someone without fully trusting yourself? I keep telling myself that I’ll be fine, that I’m strong enough to handle whatever happens, but the truth is, I don’t know if I am. There’s this voice in my head telling me that I can’t take the risk, that I’m not ready for it. But there’s another part of me, the part that I keep pushing away, that says maybe it’s time to stop running. Maybe it’s time to stop guarding my heart so fiercely, to stop holding back for fear of what might happen.

I haven’t talked to Sarah about any of this, not yet. I don’t want to make it awkward between us, and I definitely don’t want her to feel like I’m unsure of her. I think she knows something’s up, though. She’s been quieter than usual lately, and I can tell she’s picking up on my mood. It’s like she’s waiting for me to open up, waiting for me to let her in. But I don’t know if I’m ready for that. I don’t know if I can give her the kind of commitment she deserves.

And yet, part of me wonders if this is the person I’ve been waiting for all along. Someone who might just be the key to breaking down the walls I’ve built up. Maybe Sarah is the one who can teach me that it’s okay to be vulnerable, to let someone love me even when I don’t have all the answers. But how do I take that first step? How do I admit to myself that I want more than just a surface-level connection?

I guess, for now, I’ll just have to wait. I’ll wait for the moment when I’m ready, or when she’s ready to show me that it’s worth taking the leap. I’ll wait for the day when I stop feeling so damn afraid of letting someone in.
