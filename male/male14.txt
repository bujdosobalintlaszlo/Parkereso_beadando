I’ve been thinking about Sarah a lot lately, more than usual. I don’t even know where it all started—well, I guess I do, but I can’t quite wrap my head around it. I remember the first time we met. It wasn’t anything particularly special, just an ordinary day at the café. But there was something about her. She had this easy smile that seemed to make everyone around her feel at ease. It didn’t take long for me to notice how much she lit up the room. I was just trying to get my coffee and leave, but I ended up sitting there longer than I’d intended, just listening to her talk to her friends.

We didn’t talk much that day, but there was something about her energy that stayed with me. A couple of weeks later, we ran into each other again. This time we actually exchanged a few words, and I found myself wanting to know more about her. We started seeing each other more often, but it was always casual—mostly just friendly chats over coffee or quick texts here and there. At first, I was content with that. She seemed so confident, so comfortable in her own skin, and I admired that about her. But as time went on, I realized something. I started looking forward to those texts. I found myself hoping that she'd reach out first, even though I never admitted it to anyone—not even myself.

I think I’m afraid of what’s happening. I don’t want to admit it, but I feel like I’m falling for her. And it’s terrifying. The last time I allowed myself to get this close to someone, it ended badly. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that feeling of betrayal. That trust I gave, only to have it crushed. It took me a long time to rebuild myself after that. So now, every time I start to feel something for Sarah, it’s like my defenses go up. I’m scared. I don’t want to go through the same heartbreak again. I want to protect myself from the inevitable disappointment I’m almost certain is coming.

But with Sarah, it’s different. Or at least, I want it to be. When I’m with her, it feels like I can be myself, like I don’t need to pretend to be anyone else. She makes me feel seen in a way I haven’t felt in a long time. And she’s funny—like, really funny. The way she can make me laugh even on the worst days is something I never thought I’d find again. But it’s more than that. She’s thoughtful and caring in a way that makes me feel appreciated, even for the small things. I guess that’s what makes this whole thing so confusing for me. I’m not sure how to navigate these feelings, especially with the baggage I’m carrying from the past.

I know I need to be honest with myself, and with her. But every time I think about telling her how I feel, I hesitate. I keep telling myself that I should just enjoy what we have, that I shouldn’t complicate things. But the more I try to push it aside, the stronger my feelings for her become. And every time I see her, it’s like my heart skips a beat. I catch myself thinking about the future, imagining what it would be like if we were together—if we could be more than just friends.

But then doubt creeps in. I start to wonder if I’m reading too much into it. Maybe she doesn’t feel the same way. Maybe she just sees me as a friend, and nothing more. I don’t want to ruin that. Our friendship is too important to me, and I can’t afford to lose that, not when it feels like it’s the only thing I’ve got right now. What if I tell her how I feel, and she doesn’t feel the same? What if she pulls away, and the whole dynamic shifts? It’s like I’m stuck in this emotional limbo, unable to move forward, but afraid to go back.

I think the hardest part is not knowing what she feels. We’ve had these deep conversations, and I can’t help but wonder if she’s picking up on the same things I am. Maybe she feels it too. But then again, maybe I’m just imagining it. I guess I’ll never know unless I take that leap. But it’s so much easier to stay in this comfortable, safe space of uncertainty. At least this way, I don’t risk losing anything. But at the same time, I know I’m only fooling myself. If I don’t make a move, I’ll regret it. I’ll regret not taking the chance when I had the opportunity.

I don’t know what I’m afraid of anymore. Maybe I’m afraid of failing. Maybe I’m afraid of finding out that I’m not what she wants, or that I’m just not good enough. The last thing I want is to feel rejected, to put myself out there and have her not feel the same way. But at the same time, if I don’t try, I’ll never know.

So I guess the next step is figuring out how to be honest with her. How do I tell her what I’m feeling without overcomplicating things? How do I express this without scaring her off, or worse, ruining everything we’ve built? I need to figure it out soon. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I don’t want to be afraid anymore. I don’t want to let fear control my life. If I want something with her, I need to take that risk. Because, at the end of the day, I’d rather know than spend the rest of my life wondering “what if.”
