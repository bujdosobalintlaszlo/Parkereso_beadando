Lately, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. It’s strange—whenever I find myself alone with my thoughts, it feels like the world slows down. Time doesn’t seem to matter as much, and I can reflect on everything in my life. Today, though, was different. I found myself lost in the idea of relationships. I never thought of myself as someone who would get too wrapped up in finding "the one," but here I am, wondering if I'm missing something.

I’m 38 now, and if I’m being completely honest with myself, I’ve spent more of my adult life focused on career advancement and building financial security than I have on forming meaningful connections. Sure, I’ve dated here and there, had a few long-term relationships, but nothing ever really stuck. I tell myself that I’m happy with my independent lifestyle, and in a lot of ways, I am. But as I get older, it’s becoming clearer that I want more than just a successful career and a comfortable life. I want companionship. I want someone to share it all with—the good, the bad, and everything in between.

I met Lucy a few weeks ago. She’s smart, adventurous, and has an energy about her that I find incredibly captivating. The first time we met, we spent hours talking about everything from our childhood memories to our views on the future. I could tell that there was a real connection there. But as things progressed, I started to hesitate. I don’t know if it’s because of my past or if it’s just a fear of getting hurt, but I find myself questioning everything. Is this what I really want? Or am I just comfortable with the idea of being with someone? Am I just afraid of being alone?

It’s frustrating, really. I’m not the type of person who usually overthinks things, but when it comes to relationships, I’m like a different person. With Lucy, I feel like we click on so many levels, but there’s a part of me that’s hesitant to take the next step. I’ve been hurt before—deeply hurt—and maybe I’ve built these emotional walls around myself as a way of protecting myself. But I can’t keep living this way. I can’t keep running from what might be real and meaningful just because I’m afraid of it.

I think I need to open up more. Not just to Lucy, but to myself. It’s easy to get caught up in the idea of being self-sufficient, but sometimes, I forget that I don’t have to do everything on my own. Relationships aren’t just about having someone by your side—they’re about growth, partnership, and support. If I want that in my life, I need to be vulnerable, take risks, and trust again. Lucy seems like the kind of person I could build something real with. I just need to let go of my doubts and let things happen naturally.

The next time I see her, I’ll make sure I’m present. I won’t hide behind my fears. If I really want a future with someone, I have to take that leap.
